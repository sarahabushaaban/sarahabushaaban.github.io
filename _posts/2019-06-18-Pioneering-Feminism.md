The Nursing Sisters were also trailblazers, in that they were the first group of women allowed to vote in a Canadian federal election. This came after years of activism, which included efforts of peaceful protest, such as Nellie McClung -  one of Canada's most acclaimed feminist activists - orchestrating a satirical play that reversed the roles of men and women in Winnipeg. 
Here, you can see a photograph of the historic moment a group of nurses were allowed to vote for the very first time. The caption and photo were retrieved from the [Elections Canada website](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=his&document=chap2&lang=e).

If so, they were among the first Canadian women to vote in a dominion election.</sub
