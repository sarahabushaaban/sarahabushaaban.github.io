## The Faces

There are scarce resources available pertaining to the 1918 Nursing Sisters that served at Eastbourne. After conducting an intensive search for fatalities and images of the women that served in the Sussex base, and yielding limited results, I thought some global data could be utilized to demonstrate the role these volunteers played. 

Documented Nursing Sister deaths, retrieved from [*The Nursing Sisters of Canada*](https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/those-who-served/women-and-war/nursing-sisters) indicate that between the years of 1915 and 19147, 1918 was the year that saw the most casualties. According to the data, 42 Nursing Sisters died that year, serving in different parts of the world, losing their lives due to various causes. These are their faces.
