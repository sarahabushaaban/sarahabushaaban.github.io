### Canada's Wartime Nursing Sisters
During the First World War, a group of women tirelessly tended to wounded Canadian soldiers. Their formal title was "nursing sisters", but by their patients, they were dubbed *bluebirds*, for their uniform of white veils and blue dresses. Tales of the war have so often championed the men that fought on the battlegrounds. ***But what of the women that nursed their wounds?*** 

This is dedicated to the women that left their lives and their own families behind to take care of the heirs of other familys' legacies. **2,485 women** served globally in the Canadian Army Medical Corps in WWI. But this research takes a closer look at those who served in 1918, documented in the [14th Canadian General Hospital War Diaries](http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=2005110&rec_nbr_list=3366167,3203123,2005097,2005100,2005101,2005099,2005096,2005110,2005108,2005106).
